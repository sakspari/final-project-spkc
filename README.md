## About The Project

The **Corn Variety Decision Support System** is a sophisticated web application designed to simplify the complex process of selecting the most suitable corn varieties. Built as a final project for SPKC, this tool empowers agricultural decision-makers by providing a user-friendly interface to filter, compare, and analyze corn varieties based on a wide range of critical criteria. By leveraging comprehensive data, the system removes guesswork and facilitates an informed, strategic selection process.

### Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to get your development environment running.

1. Clone the RepositoryFirst, clone the project from GitHub to your local machine.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sakspari/final-project-spkc.git
    cd final-project-spkc
    ```
2. Install Project DependenciesChoose your preferred package manager and run one of the following commands in the project's root directory.Note: pnpm is the recommended choice for this project.

    **Using pnpm (Recommended)**
        
        pnpm install
        
    **Using npm**

        npm install

    **Using Bun**
    
        bun install

3. Build the Project for Production before running the application, it's best practice to create a production-ready build. This optimizes the code for performance.

    **Using pnpm**

        pnpm build

    **Using npm**

        npm run build

    **Using Bun**

        bun run build

4. Start the Server once the build is complete, you can start the local production server.

    **Using pnpm**

        pnpm start

    **Using npm**

        npm run start

    **Using Bun**

        bun run start

### ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations! The application should now be running on http://localhost:3000.

### Development Mode: 
If you plan to actively develop and want features like hot-reloading, you can run pnpm dev, npm run dev, or bun dev instead of the build and start commands.
