## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
Depending on your preference, you will also need npm (comes with Node.js), Yarn, or Bun.

- **npm:** Comes with Node.js.
- **Yarn:** `npm install --global yarn`
- **Bun:** `npm install --global bun` (or see [Bun's official installation guide](https://bun.sh/docs/installation))

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    First, clone the project to your local machine using Git:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sakspari/final-project-spkc.git
    cd final-project-spkc
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    Navigate to the project directory and install the necessary dependencies using your preferred package manager:

    - **Using npm:**

      ```bash
      npm install
      ```

    - **Using yarn:**

      ```bash
      yarn install
      ```

      _(Note: `yarn` by itself usually works for installing)_

    - **Using bun:**
      ```bash
      bun install
      ```

### Running the Development Server

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server:

- **Using npm:**

  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```

- **Using yarn:**

  ```bash
  yarn dev
  ```

- **Using bun:**
  ```bash
  bun dev
  ```

This will typically start the application on `http://localhost:3000`. Open this URL in your web browser to see the application.

### Building for Production (Optional)

If you want to build the application for production, you can use the following commands:

- **Using npm:**

  ```bash
  npm run build
  npm run start
  ```

- **Using yarn:**

  ```bash
  yarn build
  yarn start
  ```

- **Using bun:**

  ```bash
    bun run build
    bun run start
  ```

  The `build` command creates an optimized production build of the application. The `start` command then runs this production build.
